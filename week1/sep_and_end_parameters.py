#sep parameter = as we know after every comma a space appears just like that is we put sept=","
#instead of space a comma will appear at every space present 

print("gugu", "gaga", sep = "+")

#if we add end="-"
#it will end the sentence with that character and if there is another print statement below that it will be automatically be shifted to the same line.

print("gugu","gaga", sep = "+", end = "=")
print("gugaguga")
